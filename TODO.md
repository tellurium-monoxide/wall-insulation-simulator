- [ ] Improve and complete localization
- [ ] Make an help popup window and add tooltips where necessary
- [ ] Slider to change layer width ?


### Solver features

- [ ] Add interfacial thermal resistance at junctions to outside
- [ ] Variable inside temperature : ask room sizes and heating power
- [ ] Variable outside temperature: periodic cycle with P1 interpolations

### Solver performance
- [ ] Implicit solver (most important)
- [ ] Parallel solver

### Done âœ“

#### Interface/UXP

- [x] Save preset wall to current session
