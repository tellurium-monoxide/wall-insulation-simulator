This software is an interactive pedagogic tool whose main goal is to illustrate how heat passes through a wall.
It aims to illustrate the concepts of "thermal resistance", which quantify the amount of heat that moves from one side of the wall to the other, and "thermal inertia", which is the time a temperature change on one side takes before it is felt on the other side.

It results from a personnal project where I aimed to get a first experience creating a software while also creating something potentially useful to people I know.


In the following sections, I describe the main tools offered by this program and try to provide a basic tutorial.
